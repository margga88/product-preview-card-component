## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Cube CSS methodology


### What I learned

This was a project that somehow started to draw more of my skills, polish some, and learn others.

- I'm slowly structuring projects faster and keeping my code cleaner with the help of the Cube CSS methodology.
- I could finally put in practice the flex-direction property on a project.
- I'm thinking carefully about handling the queries adequately and experimenting with some values.
- Learned about the differences between display and visibility and how to handle them according to the case.
- Learned a bit more about buttons, which I couldn't apply in order to stick to the requirements of the challenge.

I surely would never forget this code in particular (to hide images):


```css
.img {
  display: none;
  visibility: hidden;
}
```


### Continued development

I can't say anything else but hope to keep up with this progress and that I can't wait to do another project, to see what I'll learn or relearn this time. 

### Useful resources

- [What is the difference between visibility:hidden and display:none?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/133051/what-is-the-difference-between-visibilityhidden-and-displaynone#133064) - This was most helpful when I tried to figure out how to hide or show the images on CSS.

- [What is the difference between visibility:hidden and display:none ?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/css/what-is-the-difference-between-visibilityhidden-and-displaynone/) - While I didn't get to use this resource, it gives a wonderful explanation on the issue, plus some good examples.

## Acknowledgments

To my old monitor, which despite being old and gives me around 50% of visibility, it doesn't die, allowing me to keep doing projects while I save for a new one.
